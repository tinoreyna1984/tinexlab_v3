## Overview

This is my personal site. It's the result of most of my web development knowledge put in practice, mainly due to my need of going deep in my career as a frontend web developer.

### Built With

- JSX + CSS + SASS
- Next.js and a few Node.js libraries

## Features

- Mobile first
- Dark mode with local storage feature
- This application/site was also created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/5ZnOYsSXM24JWnCsNFlt) was to build an own portfolio satisfying some stories in the description.

## Acknowledgements

- My teachers Juan de la Torre and Fernando Herrera.
- Vercel (vercel.com) and Next.js. The last one is my favorite framework so far.
